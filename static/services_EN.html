      <h2>More Than Just an Essay</h2>

        about themselves. In this process, we guide you to reflect on your past

      <h2>Hear From Former Customers</h2>
      <p>Here is what a few recent customers had to say about our essays:</p>
      <p>"I've got offers from four schools so far and two of them offer
        scholarships. There are another three interviews on the way. Thank you
        so much for your help. The essays you wrote were really good and you helped
         me overcome a lot of difficulties."</p>
      <p>- J Yang (2020 Graduate school applicant)</p>
      <p>“We are very satified with the English essay you wrote. You combined
        the information we provided with your knowledge about the university.
        My son says the essay is very impressive and articulates what he wants
        to express even though the Chinese content he provided was abstract. He
        wants to learn from you. Thank you very much.”</p>
      <p>- Parent of J Dou (2019 College applicant)</p>
